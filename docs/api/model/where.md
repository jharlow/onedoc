OneTable `where` clauses are a convenient way to express DynamoDB filter expressions. DynamoDB ExpressionAttributeNames and Values are one of the least fun parts of DynamoDB. OneTable makes this much easier via the use of templated `where` clauses to express complex filter expressions.

A `where` clause may be used with `find`, `scan`, `create`, `delete` or `update` APIs to specify a Filter or Conditional update expression. OneTable will parse the `where` clause and extract the names and values to use with the DynamoDB API.

For example:

```javascript
let adminUsers = await User.find({}, {
    where: '(${role} = {admin}) and (${status} = @{status})',
    substitutions: {
        status: 'current'
    }
})
```

OneTable will extract property names defined inside `${}` braces, variable substitutions in `@{}` braces and values inside `{}` braces and will automatically define your filter or conditional expressions and the required ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues.

If a value inside `{}` is a number, it will be typed as a number for DynamoDB. To force a value to be treated as a string, wrap it in quotes, for example: `{"42"}`.

Note: the property name is an unmapped schema property name and not a mapped attribute name.

Substitutions also support a `splat` syntax for use with filterExpressions and the `IN` operator.

With this syntax, the list is expanded in-situ and each list item is defined as a separate ExpressionAttributeValue.

```javascript
let adminUsers = await User.find({}, {
    where: '(${role} IN (@{...roles}))',
    substitutions: {
        roles: ['user', 'admin']
    }
})
```

## Where Clause Operators

You can use the following operators with a `where` clause:

* < <= = <> >= >
* AND OR NOT BETWEEN IN
* ()
* attribute_exists()
* attribute_not_exists()
* attribute_type()
* begins_with()
* contains()
* not_contains()
* size

Where clauses when used with `find` or `scan` on non-key attributes can also use the `<>` not equals operator.
